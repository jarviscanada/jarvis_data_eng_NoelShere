# Noel Shere . Jarvis Consulting
I am a recent graduate with a diploma in Computer Programming from Seneca College. My passion for programming started when I took my first technology class in high school, and since then, I have been very passionate about developing applications. My most-used technologies are Java, SQL/RDBMS, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Git. I have completed the Data Analyst program by Npower Canada where I learned Python, Excel, and Azure Fundamentals. During the pandemic, I began developing Android applications using Android Studio which helped me keep my coding skills up-to-date. I have recently joined Jarvis as a Data Engineer to improve my skillset and familiarize myself with industry-standard technologies and workflows.

## Skills

**Proficient:** Java, Linux/Bash, RDBMS/SQL, Agile/Scrum, Git

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NoelShere](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NoelShere/tree/Profile)
 

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NoelShere/tree/Profile/linux_sql)]: Designed and implemented a Linux cluster agent to preserve and monitor real-time data of nodes running on CentOS 7. The application performs real-time data collection of hardware specifications and CPU memory usage. Data is collected and stored in a Postgresql database and is provisioned using Docker. Crontab is used to periodically to collect resource usage data. Lastly, SQL is used to query the collected data.   
**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NoelShere/tree/Profile/core_java)]:
      
- Grep App: Created a java application that mimics the Linux 'grep' command to search and retrieve matching strings from a given file. Technologies used for this project are Maven, Java, and Docker. Implementation of the backend uses encapsulation and an interface to provide a flexible, organized implementation of the program. Deployment is done by dockerizing the app which includes building an image locally, running the docker container, and pushing it to Docker Hub to verify the image.

- JDBC App: The JDBC API establishes a connection between the java Customer program to a PostgreSQL database instance. The basic flow of the JDBC app follows a simple process of mounting the driver, followed by creating a connection to the database, executing SQL statements, commit/rollback, and finally closing the connection. The application consists of multiple java classes, each with its own function that allows the user to access database elements with pre-defined SQL queries within the Customer DAO class.


## Highlighted Projects


- Road Rules Practice Test Application [[GitHub](https://github.com/NoelShere/Android-Studio-Development---G1-Practice-Test-Application))]: This project was created using Java in Android Studio. The user interface was built using constraint layouts, relative layouts, scroll views, buttons, and images. To have the best user experience possible, animated button clicks and layout transitions are implemented. On the programming side of things, arrays and double arrays are used to store the question and answers. I have used methods to update the Q&A when an answer is clicked. Lastly, implemented Google Firebase for sending internal notifications right to the application and uploaded the application to the Google Play Store. 

## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2022-present)**: Working in an agile workflow environment along side other engineers to manage and complete various software projects. Appointed as a team lead for a sprint session and conducted daily scrum meetings with my team of data engineers to stay updated and acknowledge everyones daily tasks. Completed project work through tickets and followed the Gitflow approach to allow senior developers to review the work on Github.

**Community Canvasser**: Achev  (Aug - Sept 2021) Educated approximately 600 residences and businesses to create awareness about the Light Rail System resulting in increased awareness amongst residents. Developed geographic based presentations to inform the public about new utilities and services resulting in a wider public acceptance. Highlighted concerns and issues in daily demographic reports to induce faster resolutions for residents and businesses. 

**Content Creator**: The Dam (July - Aug 2019) Created eye-catching info graphs and detailed flyers for social media platforms resulting in awareness of the program. Utilized Photoshop and Canva to create outstanding flyers resulting in a high volume of students participating in the program. Collaborated in wrap up meetings to communicate and plan new ideas, resulting in increased team productivity.
