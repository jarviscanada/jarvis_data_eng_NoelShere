# Noel Shere . Jarvis Consulting
Hi, my name is Noel, I have a diploma in Computer Programming from Seneca College. The Computer Programming diploma has given me the opportunity to work on different assignments and projects which allowed me to gain and grow my knowledge. Further, this has also empowered me to solve and tackle difficult challenges. I am passionate about developing applications and websites. I am a team player and can collaborate with team members to work towards a common goal. I have recently joined Jarvis as a Data Engineer trainee to improve on my skillset and familiarize myself with real-world projects to continue to grow and apply knowledge throughout the program.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NoelShere](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NoelShere)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NoelShere/tree/develop/linux_sql)]: Designed and implemented a linux cluster agent to preserve and monitor real-time data of nodes running on CentOS. Application performs real-time data collection of hardware specifications and CPU memory usage. Created a Data Definition Language (DDL) script to hold specified data into tables used in the database. Modified 'host_info.sh' and 'host_usage.sh' to retrieve the necessary and insert it to the database.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NoelShere/tree/develop/core_java)]:
      
- Grep App: Created a java application that mimics the Linux 'grep' command to search and retrieve matching strings from a given file. Technologies used for this project are Maven, Java, Docker and IntelliJ IDE. Implementation of the backend uses Encapsulation and an interface to provide a flexible, organised implementation of the program. Deployment is done by dockerizing the app which includes building an image locally, running the docker container and pushing the it to Docker Hub to verify the image.

- JDBC App: The JDBC API establishes a connection between the java Customer program to a PostgreSQL database instance. The basic flow of the JDBC app follows a simple process of mounting the driver, followed by creating a connection to the database, executing SQL statements, commit/rollback and finally closing the connection. The application consists of multiple java classes, each with its own function that allows the user to access database elements with pre-defined SQL queries within the Customer DAO class.
